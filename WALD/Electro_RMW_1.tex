\section{The Fundamental Electromagnetic Variables\\ Are the Potentials, Not the Field Strengths}

\section{Electromagnetic Energy, Momentum, and Stress\\ Are an Integral Part of the Theory}

\section{Electromagnetic Fields Should Not Be Viewed\\ as Being Produced by Charged Matter}

\section{At a Fundamental Level, Classical Charged\\ Matter Must Be Viewed as Continuous\\ Rather Than Point-Like}
