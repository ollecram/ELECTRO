\chapter{THE ELECTRIC FIELD}\label{ch:B1}

\section{Coulomb's Law}\label{sec:1.1} 
The starting problem of electrostatics is to determine the force caused by the presence of a \tit{source} charge $q$ at location $\vb{r}'$ on a \tit{test} charge $Q$  at $\vb{r}$ when both charges are \tit{at rest} in a given \tit{inertial} frame of reference. The answer to this problem is \tbf{Coulomb's law}\footnote{The absence of scaling factors in Coulomb's law is a distinctive feature of the Gaussian system of units, which is adopted in these notes.}
\begin{equation}
\vb{F}_{Gauss} = \frac{q Q}{s^2} \vu{s}\label{eq:B.1}
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.2}
\vb{s} = \vb{r} - \vb{r}'
\end{equation}

is the \tbi{separation vector}  between the the two charges, directed from the source point $q$ at $\vb{r}'$ to the test point $Q$ at $\vb{r}$ , $s = \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}$ and 
$\vu{s} = \vb{s}/s$.

Based on the \tbi{superposition principle}, the effect of multiple source charges (at rest) $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ on the test charge $Q$ is simply the sum over all sources of the force generated by each one of them
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.3}
\vb{F} =  \vb{F}_1 + \vb{F}_2 + \cdots + \vb{F}_n = Q \left( \frac{q_1}{s_1^2} \vu{s}_1 + \frac{q_2}{s_2^2} \vu{s}_2 + \cdots + \frac{q_n}{s_n^2} \vu{s}_n \right)
\end{equation}

Force has dimension $[m\,l\, t^{-2}]$. The \tbi{newton} is the unit of force in SI and MKSA, were the unit of mass (1 Kg) is $10^3$ times the unit of mass (1 g) in Gaussian units. The SI and MKSA unit of length (1 meter) is $10^2$ times the unit of length (1 cm) in Gaussian units. Therefore,\\
\tbi{1 newton} = $10^5$ \tbi{dynes}, where the \tbi{dyna} is the Gaussian unit of force.  

\section{Conversion between Gaussian and SI units}\label{sec:1.2}
Equation \ref{eq:B.1} assumes Gaussian units, where the unit of force is the \tit{dyna}: a force that causes the speed of a $1$ gram particle to increase by $1$ centimeter per second on every second. This equation can be seen as a way to fix the unit of charge, which in the Gaussian system is called \tbf{electrostatic unit} (\tbf{esu}). 
The following table lists the units of \tit{length}, \tit{mass}, \tit{force} and \tit{charge} in the Gaussian and SI (MKSA) units, respectively:\\ 

\begin{tabular}{r|c|c|r}
         & Gauss      &  SI   & Scale\\ \hline
   time  & second     &  second & $1$\\
  length & centimeter &  meter & $10^2$\\
  mass   & gram       &  kilogram & $10^3$\\
  force  & dyna       &  newton & $10^5$\\
  charge & esu        &  coulomb & $3 \times 10^9$\\
\end{tabular}\\ 

The adimensional scale factor $3 \times 10^9$ between the \tbf{esu} and \tbf{coulomb} units for the electric charge (which appears at the intersection of the rightmost column and last row in the above table) means that one coulomb contains \tit{three billions} esu's, which is why the Gaussian units are often chosen to discuss electromagnetic interactions at the atomic or molecular level, while SI units are preferred for engineering application involving macroscopic systems.


\subsection*{Problem 1}
Determine the ratio between $1$ \tbf{coulomb}, the SI unit of charge, and $1$ \tbf{esu} (aka \tbf{statcoulomb}), where the latter is the unit of charge in the Gauss electromagnetic units. 
Start from equation (\ref{eq:B.1}) where \tit{force} between two point charges $q$ and $Q$ is expressed in the Gauss units and make use of the corresponding equation where length, time and charge are expressed in the \tbf{SI (MKSA)} units, namely
\begin{equation}
\vb{F}_{SI}  = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{\tilde{q} \tilde{Q}}{\tilde{s}^2} \vu{s}\,,\label{eq:B.4}
\end{equation}

where $$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \frac{4 \pi c^2}{10^7} = \frac{c^2}{10^7}\,.$$

\subsection*{Solution}

Let consider two charged, massive particles, namely a \tit{source} particle $p$ of charge $q$ (which for simplicity is supposed to be at rest) and a \tit{test} particle $P$ of mass $M$ and charge $Q$ which is free to move. 

The acceleration of the particle $P$ in the field of particle $p$ does not depend on the system of units which one adopts\footnote{Only its \tit{numerical value} does.}. The units of acceleration $a$ in the Gauss and SI units are $[cm \cdot sec^{-2}]$ and $[m \cdot sec^{-2}]$, respectively. Therefore, an acceleration of $1 m \cdot sec^{-2}$ in SI units corresponds to $10^2 cm \cdot sec^{-2}$ in Gauss units. 

In the following, $q$ and $Q$ denote the numerical value of \tit{electrical charge} for the particles $p$ and $P$ in the Gauss units (esu), while $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{Q}$ denote the numerical value of \tit{electrical charge} for the same particles $p$ and $P$ in the SI (MKSA) units (coulomb). 

Let also $m$ be the \tit{mass} of particle $p$ and $M$ be the mass of particle $P$ in the Gauss units (gram), while $\tilde{m}$ and $\tilde{M}$ denote the numerical value of \tit{mass} for the same particles $p$ and $P$ in the SI (MKSA) units (kilogram).

With these stipulations, the numerical values of the acceleration of particle $P$ in the Gauss and SI units are, respectively 
$$a = \frac{F_{Gauss}}{M}\,=\, \frac{qQ}{M\,s^2}\, \text{cm}\, \cdot\, \text{sec}^{-2}\,\text{, and}$$    
$$\tilde{a} = \frac{F_{SI}}{\tilde{M}}\,=\, \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{\tilde{q}\tilde{Q}}{\tilde{M}\,\tilde{s}^2}\,
=\, \frac{\tilde{c}^2}{10^7} \frac{\tilde{q}\tilde{Q}}{\tilde{M}\,\tilde{s}^2}\,  \text{m}\, \cdot\, \text{sec}^{-2}\, \text{.}$$   

Taking the ratio of corresponding terms in the two equations, while denoting with $\tilde{c} = 3 \times 10^8$ the speed of light in the SI units, we get 
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{\tilde{a}} = 10^2 &=  \frac{q}{\tilde{q}}  \frac{Q}{\tilde{Q}} \frac{\tilde{M}}{M} \frac{\tilde{s}^2}{s^2} \frac{10^7}{\tilde{c}^2}\\
                           &=  \frac{q}{\tilde{q}}  \frac{Q}{\tilde{Q}} \cdot       10^{-3} \cdot           10^{-4} \frac{10^7}{\tilde{c}^2}\\
                           &= \left( \frac{Q}{\tilde{Q}} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\tilde{c}^2}\,,
\end{align*}

which can be reduced to $$\left( \frac{Q}{\tilde{Q}} \right)^2 = (10 \tilde{c})^2\,\text{or, taking the square root }$$
$$Q = \tilde{Q} \cdot (3 \times 10^9)\,,$$
whereby $Q$, the charge of a particle $P$ in the Gauss unit (\tbf{esu}, \tit{aka} \tbf{statcoulomb}) is a number $3 \times 10^9$ larger than the same charge expressed in the SI (MKSA) unit of charge (\tbf{coulomb}). Of course this means that 
$$1 \text{ \tbf{coulomb} } = 3 \times 10^9 \text{ \tbf{esu} .} $$

\section{The Electric Field}\label{sec:1.3}
The \tbi{electrostatic field} $\vb{E}(\vb{r})$ is, by definition, the force exerted on a \tbi{unit test charge} located at the point $\vb{r}$ by all other charges (assumed at rest). With $\vb{s} = \vb{r} - \vb{r}'$, we therefore write

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:B.5}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \frac{\vb{F}}{Q} =  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{q_i}{s_i^2} \vu{s}_i
\end{equation}

In terms of $\vb{E}(\vb{r})$ the \tbf{Coulomb's law} \ref{eq:B.3} can be rewritten as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:B.6}
\vb{F}(\vb{r}) = Q \vb{E}(\vb{r})\,.
\end{equation}


\subsection*{Example 1}
Find the electric field a distance $z$ above the midpoint between two equal charges ($q$), a distance $d$ apart.

\subsection*{Solution}
Let $\vb{E}_1$ be the field of the left charge alone, and $\vb{E}_2$ that of the right charge alone. Adding them (vectorially), the horizontal ($\vu{i}$) components cancel and the vertical ($\vu{k}$) components conspire (see Griffiths Fig. 4)
$$E_z = 2 \frac{q}{s^2} \cos \theta\,,$$ where $s = \sqrt{z^2 + (d/2)^2}$  and $\cos \theta = z / s$, so

$$ \vb{E} = \frac{2 q z}{[z^2 + (d/2)^2]^{3/2}} \vu{k}\,.$$ 


\section{Continuous Charge Distributions}\label{sec:1.4}

Our definition of the electric field (Eq. \ref{eq:B.5}) assumed the source of the field to be a collection of discrete point charges $q_i$. If instead the charge is distributed over some region $\omega$, the sum becomes an integral:
 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:B.7}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \int_{\omega} \frac{\vu{s}}{s^2} \dd{q}\,.
\end{equation}

If the charge is spread out along a \tit{line}, with $\lambda$ the charge per unit length, then $\dd{q} = \lambda \dd{l'}$ 
(where $\dd{l'}$ is an element of length along the line);
if the charge is spread out over a \tit{surface}, with $\sigma$ the charge per unit area, then $\dd{q} = \sigma \dd{a'}$ 
(where $\dd{a'}$ is an element of area on the surface);
if the charge is spread out within a \tit{volume}, with $\rho$ the charge per unit volume, then $\dd{q} = \rho \dd{\tau'}$
(where $\dd{\tau'}$ is an element of volume):

$$ \dd{q} \rightarrow \lambda \dd{l'} \sim  \sigma \dd{a'} \sim \rho \dd{\tau'}\,. $$

Thus the electric field of a line charge is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.8}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \int_{\Lambda} \frac{\lambda(\vb{r'})}{s^2} \vu{s} \dd{l'}\,;
\end{equation}

for a surface charge,  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.9}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \int_{\Sigma} \frac{\sigma(\vb{r'})}{s^2} \vu{s} \dd{a'}\,;
\end{equation}

and for a volume charge,  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.10}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \int_{\Omega} \frac{\rho(\vb{r'})}{s^2} \vu{s} \dd{\tau'}\,.
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:B.10} itself is often referred to as \quotes{Coulomb's law}, because it is such a short step from the original 
(\ref{eq:B.1}), and because a volume charge is in a sense the most general and realistic case.\\

Please note carefully the meaning of $\vb{s} = s \vu{s}$ in these formulas. Originally, in equation \ref{eq:B.3}, $\vb{s}$ stood for the vector from the source charge $q_i$ to the field point $\vb{r}$. Correspondingly, in Eqs. \ref{eq:B.7}-\ref{eq:B.10}, 
$\vb{s}$ is the vector from $\dd{q}$ (therefore from $\dd{l'}$, $\dd{a'}$, or $\dd{\tau'}$) to the field point $\vb{r}$.\\

\tbi{Warning:} The unit vector $\vu{s}$ is \tit{not} constant; its \tit{direction} depends on the source point $\vb{r'}$, hence it \tit{cannot be taken outside of the integrals} (Eqs. \ref{eq:B.7}-\ref{eq:B.10}). In practice, \tit{you must work with Cartesian components} even if you use curvilinear coordinates to perform the integration ($\vu{i}$, $\vu{j}$, $\vu{k}$ \tit{are} constant, and \tit{do} come out). 


\subsection*{Example 2}
Find the electric field a distance $z$ \tbi{above the midpoint} of a straight line segment of length $2L$ that carries a uniform charge $\lambda$. 

\subsection*{Solution}
The simplest method is to chop the line into symmetrically placed pairs (at $\pm x$), quote the result of Ex. 1 (with $d/2\,\rightarrow x$, $q\, \rightarrow \lambda \dd{x}$) and integrate ($x\,:\,0 \rightarrow L$).\\
But here's a more general approach:\footnote{Ordinarily I'll put a prime on the source coordinates, but where no confusion can arise I'll remove the prime to simplify the notation.} 

\begin{align*}
\vb{r} = z \vu{k}, \quad \vb{r}' &= x \vu{i}, \quad \dd{l}' = \dd{x}\\
\vb{s} = \vb{r} - \vb{r}' = z \vu{k} -  x \vu{i}, \quad s &= \sqrt{z^2 + x^2}, \quad \vu{s} = \frac{\vb{s}}{s} = \frac{z \vu{k} -  x \vu{i}}{\sqrt{z^2 + x^2}}\,.
\end{align*}

\begin{align}
\vb{E} &= \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{\lambda}{z^2 + x^2} \frac{z \vu{k} -  x \vu{i}}{\sqrt{z^2 + x^2}} \dd{x}\label{eq:B.11}\\
       &= \lambda \left[ z \vu{k}  \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{(z^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \dd{x}  - \vu{i} \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{x}{(z^2 + x^2)^{3/2}} \dd{x} \right]\label{eq:B.12}\\
       &= \lambda \left[ z \vu{k}  \left( \frac{x}{z^2 \sqrt{z^2 + x^2}}\right)\bigg\rvert_{-L}^{L} - \vu{i} \left(- \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2 + x^2}}\right)\bigg\rvert_{-L}^{L} \right]\label{eq:B.13}\\
       &= \frac{2 \lambda L}{z \sqrt{z^2 + L^2}} \vu{k}\,.\label{eq:B.14}
\end{align}

Primitives of the above two integrals for $\vb{E}$ are found in Dwight as formulas 200.03 and 201.03.\\

For points far from the line ($z \gg L$),
$$ \lim_{L/z \rightarrow 0}  E \simeq \frac{2\lambda L}{z^2}\,. $$
This makes sense: From far away the line looks like a point charge $q = 2\lambda L$. 
In the limit $L \rightarrow \infty$, on the other hand, we obtain the field of an infinite straight wire: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.15}
\lim_{L \rightarrow \infty} E \simeq \frac{2\lambda}{z}
\end{equation}




\subsection*{Problem 3}
Find the electric field a distance $z$ \tbi{above one end} of a straight line segment of length $L$ that carries a uniform line charge $\lambda$. Check that your formula is consistent with what you would expect for the case $z \gg L$. 

\subsection*{Solution}

Adapting a partial result (Eq. \ref{eq:B.13}) from the solution of Example 2 we get

\begin{align}
\frac{\vb{E}}{\lambda} &= \vu{k}  \left( \frac{x}{z \sqrt{z^2 + x^2}}\right)\bigg\rvert_{0}^{L} + \vu{i} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2 + x^2}}\right)\bigg\rvert_{0}^{L}\label{eq:B.16} \\
       &= \frac{L}{z\,\sqrt{z^2 + L^2}} \vu{k} + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2 + L^2}} - \frac{1}{z} \right)\,\vu{i}\,,\label{eq:B.17}
\end{align}

where $\vu{k}$ denotes any\footnote{We observe that symmetry requires the field behaviour to be the same along any segment starting at one end of the charged line and orthogonal to it.} direction \tbi{orthogonal} to the charged line segment of length $L$, which we assume to start at $x=0$ along the $\vu{i}$ axis.\\

In the limit of large distances from the $\vu{i}$ axis (when $z \gg L$) the field component \tit{orthogonal} to that axis is:
$$ \lim_{L/z \rightarrow 0}\frac{E_z}{\lambda L} = \lim_{L/z \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{z^2\,\sqrt{(1 + L^2/z^2}} = \frac{1}{z^2}\,.$$

The above result is what should be expected: at large distances the charged segment has approximately the same effect as if the same amount of charge $q'=\lambda L$ would be concentrated at the origin ($\vb{r}_{q'} = \vb{0}$). 

Measured at the same point ($\vb{r} = (0,0,z)$, with $z \gg L$) the field component along $\vu{i}$ (the direction of the charged line segment) is 
$$\frac{E_x}{\lambda L} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2 + L^2}} - \frac{1}{z}$$
In the limit where $z \gg L$ this term becomes 
$$\frac{E_x}{\lambda L} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2 + L^2}} - \frac{1}{z}  \simeq \frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{z} = 0\,.$$

Symmetry dictates $E_x$ to be exactly zero above the midpoint  of the segment charge, so at $(L/2,0,z)$. 
But of course in the limit where  $z \gg L$ the field component along $\vu{i}$ measured at $(0,0,z)$ or at $(L,0,z)$ must also be close to zero.

\subsection*{Problem 4}
Find the electric field a distance $z$ above one end of the center of a square loop (side $a$) carrying uniform line charge $\lambda$. [\tit{Hint}: Use the result of  Ex. 2.]

\subsection*{Solution}

The field produced at $\vb{r} = (0, 0, z)$ by each one of the four sides of the loop is derived from (Eq. \ref{eq:B.14}) by replacing  $z$ with $z' = \sqrt{z^2 + a^2/4}$, because Eq. \ref{eq:B.14} holds when the charged segment and the point  $\vb{r}$ are in the same plane. 
We ignore the field component $E_y$ generated by segments parallel to $\vu{i}$ and the field component $E_x$ generated by segments parallel to $\vu{j}$ because these cancel out within each pair of parallel sides. Therefore 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.18}
\frac{\vb{E}}{\lambda a} = \frac{4}{z' \sqrt{{z'}^2 + a^2/4}}\,\vu{k}
\end{equation}

When $z \gg a$ we can substitute $z$ for $z'$ in Eq. \ref{eq:B.18} and ignore the constant under the square root, whence

\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.19}
\lim_{a/z \rightarrow 0} \vb{E} = \frac{q}{z^2}\,  \vu{k}\,,  
\end{equation}
where $q = 4 \lambda a$ is the total charge of the loop.  

\subsection*{Problem 5}
Find the electric field a distance $z$ above the center of a circular loop of radius $R$ that carries a uniform line charge $\lambda$). 

\subsection*{Solution}

Let $P$ be the point of coordinates $\vb{r} = (0, 0, z)$ where the field is being evaluated. Let $p'$ denote the the infinitesimal charge element of length $R \dd{\theta}$ on the circular loop. Consider the right triangle of base $R$ and height $z$. Clearly $R^2 + z^2$ is the squared distance from the loop element at $p'$ (of charge $\lambda R \dd{\theta}$) and the point $P$. The element's contribution to the field at $P$ is $$\dd{\vb{E}} = \frac{\lambda R \dd{\theta}}{R^2 + z^2}\,. $$ 

The component of $\dd{\vb{E}}$ parallel to the $\vu{i}\:\vu{j}$ plane becomes negligible as $z \gg R$. In any case, we can apply a reasoning similar to the one used in solving Problem 4, namely we do ignore the fields component $E_x$ and $E_y$ parallel to the loop plane because for each segment $R \dd{\theta}$ there is a corresponding segment $R (\pi + \dd{\theta})$ that generates equal and \tit{opposite} components in the $\vu{i}\,\vu{j}\;$ plane. Therefore, knowing the angle $\phi$ between $\dd{\vb{E}}$ and the $\vu{k}$ axis, we obtain the exact  contribution of each element to the field $\vb{E}$ at $P$.

\begin{align*}
\vb{E} &= \vu{k}\: \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\lambda R \dd{\theta}}{(R^2 + z^2)} \cdot \cos \phi \\
       &= \vu{k}\: \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\lambda R \dd{\theta}}{(R^2 + z^2)} \cdot \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}}\\
       &= \vu{k}\: \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\lambda R z \dd{\theta}}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}\\
       &= \vu{k}\: \frac{q z}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}\,, \numberthis \label{eq:B.20}
\end{align*}

where $q =  2 \pi R \lambda$ is the loop total charge. In the limit of $z \gg R$, $E \rightarrow q\vu{k}/z^2 $, as expected.


\subsection*{Problem 6}
Find the electric field a distance $z$ above the center of a flat circular disk of radius $R$ that carries a uniform surface charge $\sigma$. What does your formula give in the limit $R \rightarrow \infty$? Also check the case $z \gg R$.  

\subsection*{Solution}
We build on top of  the solution of Problem 5 by transforming the line integrals leading to [\ref{eq:B.20}] into double integrals
\begin{align*}
\vb{E} &= \vu{k}\: \int_0^R \dd{r'} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\sigma r' \dd{\theta}}{({r'}^2 + z^2)} \cdot \cos \phi \\
       &= \vu{k}\: \int_0^R \dd{r'} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\sigma r' \dd{\theta}}{({r'}^2 + z^2)} \cdot \frac{z}{\sqrt{{r'}^2 + z^2}}\\
       &= \vu{k}\: \int_0^R \frac{2 \pi \sigma r' z }{({r'}^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \dd{r'} \\
       &= \pi \sigma z \, \int_0^R \frac{2\,r' \dd{r'}}{({r'}^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}\:\vu{k}\,, \numberthis \label{eq:B.21}
\end{align*}
  
where in the above formulas $r' = \abs{\vb{r'}} = \abs{x \vu{i} + x \vu{j}} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\;$ is the projection onto the $\vu{i}\;\vu{j}$ plane of the vector $\vb{r} = \vb{r'} + z \vu{k}$ which connects the charge element $r'\dd{\theta}$ to the point $P = z\,\vu{k}$. 

The integral (\ref{eq:B.21}) can be evaluated by using $\eta(r') = ({r'}^2 + z^2)$ as the integration variable instead of $r'$. 
Given that $\dv*{\eta}{r'} = 2 r'$, the integral in [\ref{eq:B.21}] becomes
\begin{align*}
\int_0^R \frac{2\,r' \dd{r'}}{({r'}^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} &= \int_{z^2}^{R^2 + z^2} \eta^{-3/2} \dd{\eta}\\
                                                    &= \frac{2}{\sqrt{\eta}} \bigg\rvert_{R^2 + z^2}^{z^2}\\
                                                    &= 2 \left( \frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} \right)\,. \numberthis \label{eq:B.22}
\end{align*}

Putting the above result in (\ref{eq:B.21}) we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.23}
\vb{E} =   2 \pi \sigma z \left( \frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} \right) \vu{k}\,.
\end{equation}

For $R \gg z$ the second term can be neglected, hence the field close to the disk becomes\footnote{The corresponding formula in SI units is $\vb{E}_{disk} =   \sigma/(2 \epsilon_0)\,\vu{k}\,.$}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.24}
\vb{E}_{disk} =   2 \pi \sigma\; \vu{k}\,.
\end{equation}

For $z \gg R$ the second term can be approximated as follows
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} &= \frac{1}{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2/z^2 + 1}}\\
						   &\approx \frac{1}{z} \left(1 - \frac{R^2}{2z^2}\right)\,,
\end{align*}

which substituted in [\ref{eq:B.23}] gives the expected result:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B.25}
\vb{E} \approx  2 \pi \sigma z \left( \frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{z} + \frac{R^2}{2z^3} \right) \vu{k} = \frac{\pi R^2 \sigma}{z^2} \vu{k} = \frac{Q}{z^2}  \vu{k}\,.
\end{equation}





\subsection*{Problem 7}

Find the electric field a distance $z$ from the center of a spherical surface of radius $R$ that carries a charge density $\sigma$. Treat the case $z < R$ (inside) as well as $z > R$ (outside). Express your answers in terms of the total charge $q$ on the sphere. [\tit{Hint:} Use the law of cosines to write $\vb{r}$\footnote{The vector from a source point to the field point.} in terms of $R$ and $\theta$. Be sure to take the \tit{positive} square root: $\sqrt{R^2 + z^2 - 2Rz} = (R - z)$ if $R > z$, but it's $z - R$ if $R < z$.]
