\section{THE ELECTRIC FIELD}
\subsection{Coulomb's Law}
The \tit{electric force} exerted by a \tit{source charge} $q$ located \tit{at rest} in $\vb{r}'$ on a \tit{test charge} $Q$ located at $\vb{r}$  is (\tbf{Coulomb's law})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G01_coulomb}
\vb{F} = \frac{qQ}{s^2} \vu{s}
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G01_separation}
\vb{s} = \vb{r} - \vb{r}'
\end{equation}

is the \tbi{separation vector} between the the two charges, directed from the source point to the test point. 

Based on the \tbi{superposition principle}, the effect of multiple source charges (at rest) $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ on the test charge $Q$ is simply the sum over all sources of the force generated by each one of them

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G01_superposition}
\vb{F} =  \vb{F}_1 + \vb{F}_2 + \cdots + \vb{F}_n = Q \left( \frac{q_1}{s_1^2} \vu{s}_1 + \frac{q_2}{s_2^2} \vu{s}_2 + \cdots + \frac{q_n}{s_n^2} \vu{s}_n \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Electric Field}
The \tbi{electrostatic field} $\vb{E}(\vb{r})$ is, by definition, the force exerted on a \tbi{unit test charge} located at the point $\vb{r}$ by all other charges (assumed at rest), namely

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G01_electrostatic_field}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \frac{\vb{F}}{Q} =  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{q_i}{s_i^2} \vu{s}_i
\end{equation}

In terms of $\vb{E}(\vb{r})$ the \tbf{Coulomb's law} \ref{eq:G01_superposition} can be rewritten as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G01_electrostatic_force}
\vb{F}(\vb{r}) = Q \vb{E}(\vb{r})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Problem 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Twelve equal charges, $q$ are situated at the corners of a regular 12-sided polygon (one on each numeral of a clock face). What is the net force on a test charge $Q$ at the center?
\item Suppose \tit{one} of the 12 $q$'s is removed (the one at \quotes{6 o'clock}). What is the force on $Q$? Explain your reasoning carefully.
\item Now $13$ equal charges, $q$ are placed at the corners of a regular 13-sided polygon. What is the net force on a test charge $Q$ at the center?
\item If one of the 13 $q$'s is removed what is the force on $Q$? Explain your reasoning carefully.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Solution}
a) The net force is $\vb{0}$ because the field generated by each charge is \tit{balanced} by the equal and opposite field generated by the charge that sits in front of it across the center.\\
b) This is the force exerted by the \tit{single unbalanced charge}, the one at \quotes{12 o'clock}: 
$$ \vb{F} = - \frac{qQ}{R^2}\, \vu{k}$$ 
c) The net force is still $\vb{0}$ because there is no direction the electric field $\vb{E}$ can take without breaking the symmetry of the arrangement. This means that the field generated by each charge is balanced, at the center, by the sum of the fields generated by the remaining charges.\\
d) Because of the previous point, the net force at the center is the \tit{opposite} of the force that would be added if the removed charge would be put back in. Assuming \quotes{6 o'clock} to be the place of the latter, the force has the same value computed for the case b). 

\subsubsection*{Example 1}
Find the electric field a distance $z$ above the midpoint between two equal charges ($q$) a distance $d$ apart. 

\subsubsection*{Solution}
Let choose a Cartesian reference frame with \tbi{origin} $O$ in the midpoint between the two charges, the $\vu{i}$ axis parallel to the line along which they are located, and the $\vu{k}$ axis orthogonal to that line. In this frame the position vectors of the two charges are $\vb{r}_1 = -d/2\vu{i}$ and $\vb{r}_2 = +d/2\vu{i}$, while the position at which the electric field must be computed is $\vb{r} =  z \vu{k}$. 

The separation vectors of the sources from the test point $\vb{r}$ are 
\begin{align*}
\vb{s}_1 &= \vb{r} - \vb{r}_1 = z \vu{k} + \frac{d}{2} \vu{i} \\
\vb{s}_2 &= \vb{r} - \vb{r}_2 = z \vu{k} - \frac{d}{2} \vu{i} 
\end{align*}

The next step is to take the sum \ref{eq:G01_electrostatic_field} and we observe that 

\begin{align*}
& s_1^2 = z^2 +(d/2)^2 = s_2^2 \\
& \vb{s}_1 + \vb{s}_2 = 2z \vu{k} = \sqrt{z^2 +(d/2)^2}  (\vu{s}_1 + \vu{s}_2)  \\
& \vu{s}_1 + \vu{s}_2 = \frac{\vb{s}_1 + \vb{s}_2}{\sqrt{z^2 +(d/2)^2}} = \frac{2z \vu{k}}{\sqrt{z^2 +(d/2)^2}} = 2 \cos \theta \vu{k}
\end{align*}

where $\theta$ is the angle between a separation vector with the $\vu{k}$ axis. Finally

\begin{equation*}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{q_i}{s_i^2} \vu{s}_i = \frac{q \,(\vu{s}_1 + \vu{s}_2)}{z^2 +(d/2)^2}  = \frac{2q \cos \theta \, \vu{k}}{z^2 + (d/2)^2} = \frac{2qz \, \vu{k}}{  [z^2 +(d/2)^2]^{3/2}  }
\end{equation*}

When $z \gg d$ any dependency on $d$ can be eliminated from the denominator giving, as expected 

$$\lim_{d \rightarrow 0} \vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \frac{2q \, \vu{k}}{z^2}$$ 

namely the same field as of a single particle with twice as much charge. 


\subsubsection*{Problem 2}
Find the electric field (magnitude and direction) a distance $z$ above the midpoint between equal and opposite charges ($\pm q$) a distance $d$ apart (same as Example 1, except that the charge at $x = +d/2$ is $-q$).

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The separation vectors of the sources from the test point $\vb{r}$ are 
\begin{align*}
\vb{s}_1 &= \vb{r} - \vb{r}_1 = z \vu{k} + \frac{d}{2} \vu{i} \\
\vb{s}_2 &= \vb{r} - \vb{r}_2 = z \vu{k} - \frac{d}{2} \vu{i} 
\end{align*}

The next step is to take the sum \ref{eq:G01_electrostatic_field} and we observe that 

\begin{align*}
& s_1^2 = z^2 +(d/2)^2 = s_2^2 \\
& q\,(\vb{s}_1 - \vb{s}_2) = q d\, \vu{i} = q\, \sqrt{z^2 +(d/2)^2}  (\vu{s}_1 - \vu{s}_2)  \\
& q\,(\vu{s}_1 - \vu{s}_2) =\frac{ q \, (\vb{s}_1 - \vb{s}_2)}{\sqrt{z^2 +(d/2)^2}} = \frac{qd\, \vu{i}}{\sqrt{z^2 +(d/2)^2}} = 2q \sin \theta \, \vu{i}
\end{align*}

where $\theta$ is the angle between a separation vector with the $\vu{k}$ axis. Finally

\begin{equation*}
\vb{E}(\vb{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{q_i}{s_i^2} \vu{s}_i = \frac{q \,(\vu{s}_1 - \vu{s}_2)}{z^2 +(d/2)^2}  = \frac{2q \sin \theta \, \vu{i}}{z^2 + (d/2)^2} = \frac{2qd \, \vu{i}}{  [z^2 +(d/2)^2]^{3/2}  }
\end{equation*}
